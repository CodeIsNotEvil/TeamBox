In this tutorial I'm going to explain how to collaboratively work on text documents on the TeamBox using the app 'Text Editor'...

00:09.001 --> 00:13.000
New documents can be created in this overview.

00:13.001 --> 00:21.000
Here you can also select from a list of already existing text documents and then edit the chosen one.

00:21.001 --> 00:28.000
When working together on the same text, this app allows tou to see who of your group is writing which lines.

00:28.001 --> 00:35.000
Everyone can immediatley see when someone other writes or edites text.

00:35.001 --> 00:42.000
Text can be formatted: for example you can style it bold or italic.

00:42.001 --> 00:49.000
In addition you can insert lists and indented text.

00:49.001 --> 00:57.000
You can search the hole document for specific words and replace them with others if you want to.

00:57.001 --> 01:04.000
If you're programmer you might be interested in selecting different syntax highlightings.

01:04.001 --> 01:09.000
This automatically disable the so called authorship colors.

01:09.001 --> 01:17.000
Of course, you can also disable them whitout chosing any highlighting. This simply can be done in the settings.

01:17.001 --> 01:22.000
You can set some more display preferences:

01:22.001 --> 01:28.000
For example, you can hide line numbers or chose aother font.

01:28.001 --> 01:39.000
The is also the possibility to import/upload own text documents from your computer to edit them.

01:39.001 --> 01:46.000
Be cafeful when uploading files. This overwrites the current text.

01:46.001 --> 02:00.000
Of course, you can also download and save collabboratively created text in different files formats.

02:00.001 --> 02:05.000
If you're still looking for help with other apps on the TeamBox you can find other tutorials here...

02:05.001 --> 02:10.000
Have fun working with your group on the TeamBox!
