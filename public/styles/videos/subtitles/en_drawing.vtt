In this tutorial I'm going to explain how to collaboratively 
In diesem Tutorial möchte ich erklären, wie man auf der TeamBox mit der App 'Drawing Pad' gemeinsame Bilder erstellen kann...

00:10.001 --> 00:13.000
New drawings can be created in this overview.

00:13.001 --> 00:21.000
Here you can also select from a list of already existing drawings and then edit the chosen one.

00:21.001 --> 00:24.000
By default freehand drawing is activated.

00:24.001 --> 00:35.000
From the menu you can also choose geometric shapes: you can draw straight lines, circles and squares.

00:35.001 --> 00:39.000
You can freely chose the brush thickness.

00:39.001 --> 00:45.000
In addition, it is posiible to insert text in different sizes and fonts.

00:45.001 --> 00:51.000
This text is saved as a template until you chose a new text.

00:51.001 --> 00:59.000
There is the possibility to choose between different colors for the shapes or texts.

00:59.001 --> 01:05.000
You can also draw filled circles and squares.

01:05.001 --> 01:11.000
Pictures can be imported/uploaded from your computer and edited.

01:11.001 --> 01:18.000
In addition, there is the option to save the created image for all your group members on the USB storage device.

01:18.001 --> 01:27.000
Of course these images can be exported/downloaded, too.

01:27.001 --> 01:34.000
By clicking once the complete picture can be deleted. But be careful - that affects all of you!

01:34.001 --> 01:39.000
If you're still looking for help with other apps on the TeamBox you can find other tutorials here...

01:39.001 --> 01:45.000
Have fun working with your group on the TeamBox!
