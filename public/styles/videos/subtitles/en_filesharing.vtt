In this tutorial I'm going to explain how to collaboratively share files on the TeamBox using the app 'File Sharing'...

00:09.001 --> 00:13.000
This app allows you to share files in your group

00:13.001 --> 00:23.000
as well as to access the collaboratively created pictures, mind maps, spreadsheets and texts on the TeamBox.

00:23.001 --> 00:33.000
The overview can be displayed in two different ways: you can choose betwen large icons or al list of all shared files.

00:33.001 --> 00:45.000
By drapping your files to the green drop area you can upload files. You can also click on it wich shows you as list of files on oyur computer to upload.

00:45.001 --> 00:52.000
In addition you can create folders.

00:52.001 --> 01:02.000
First you have to navigate to that folder if you want to upload anything there.

01:02.001 --> 01:13.000
Of course, you can delete files, edit their names and there is the possibility to open text and pictures in your browser

01:13.001 --> 01:21.000
You can download a file by clicking on its name

01:21.001 --> 01:29.000
- to save a complete folder as an archive you can click the download-button.

01:29.001 --> 01:39.000
If you want to move files, you have to enable this mode in the menu. Now you can chose the file

01:39.001 --> 01:52.000
and move by selecting a folder in the drop down menu.

01:52.001 --> 01:58.000
If you're still looking for help with other apps on the TeamBox you can find other tutorials here...

01:58.001 --> 02:03.000
Ich wünsche Dir und Deiner Gruppe noch viel Spaß beim Arbeiten mit der TeamBox!
