00:00.001 --> 00:09.00
In this tutorial I'm going to explain how to collaboratively plan and run projects on the TeamBox using the app 'Project Management'...

00:09.001 --> 00:22.000
When creating a project you can specify the project's name and description as well as its duration. 

00:22.001 --> 00:33.000
After creating the prokect you can see a calendar. It shows you all sceduled tasks and milestones for the project.

00:32.001 --> 00:38.000
Tasks and milestones can be added by clicking on a specific date.

00:38.001 --> 00:48.000
You can see all milestones in a list when navigating to it from the top bar.

00:46.001 --> 00:55.000
In this overview, milestones can be edited or deleted. Here you can also add new milestones.

00:55.001 --> 01:04.000
A milestone can have a descibtion as well as time limits.

01:03.001 --> 01:11.000
You can also assign a specific talk to a member of your group. All tasks are displayed in an overwiew, too.

01:11.001 --> 01:26.000
Before assigning is possible, however, a task list must be created or there must exist a milestone.

01:26.001 --> 01:31.000
Such a task list can be assigned to a milestone when creating.

01:31.001 --> 01:44.000
Once you have created a task list, you can add a task from the calendar or the task list view.

01:44.001 --> 01:50.000
A task can be assigned to a particular member of your group.

01:50.001 --> 01:56.000
Of course, both the task lists as well as the individual tasks can be edited afterwards.

01:56.001 --> 02:02.000
You can close a task list when all task in it are finished.

02:02.001 --> 02:11.000
In the menu bar you can also find a tab for messages. Group members can leave messages to each other about the project here.

02:11.001 --> 02:17.000
If you're still looking for help with other apps on the TeamBox you can find other tutorials here...

02:17.001 --> 02:22.000
Have fun working with your group on the TeamBox!
