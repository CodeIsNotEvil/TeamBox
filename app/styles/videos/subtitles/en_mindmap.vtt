00:00.001 --> 00:09.000
In this tutorial I'm going to explain how to collaboratively work out mind maps on the TeamBox using the app 'Brain Storming'

00:09.001 --> 00:13.000
New mind maps can be created in this overview.

00:13.001 --> 00:22.000
Here you can also select from a list of already existing mind maps and then edit the chosen one.

00:22.001 --> 00:26.000
I have already prepared a litle mind map for this tutorial.

00:26.001 --> 00:37.000
Otherwise, the first node - the so called root - is created automatically at startup. There you can go on creating your mind map.

00:37.001 --> 00:43.000
You can also create a root using the menu display on the right side.

00:43.001 --> 00:50.000
To add subnodes, you have to mark the node where you want to add the new one.

00:50.001 --> 00:58.000
Then you can create the new node by clicking on the icon displayed right beside the node or via the menu.

00:58.001 --> 01:02.000
By double-clicking you can rename nodes.

01:02.001 --> 01:12.000
In addition, you can design the node's color. A chosen color is automatically applied to all its sub-nodes.

01:12.001 --> 01:18.000
You can also delete a node the same way as adding one.

01:18.001 --> 01:25.000
Thiy only deletes this single node.

01:25.001 --> 01:31.000
All it's child nodes are automatically connected to the the overlying node.

01:31.001 --> 01:39.000
There is also the possibility of using the menu to delete a node and its complete sub-tree.

01:39.001 --> 01:45.000
You can save the mind map for all group members on the USB storage device.

01:45.001 --> 01:53.000
Of course, you can download a mind map as image file and save it on your computer.

01:53.001 --> 01:59.000
If you're still looking for help with other apps on the TeamBox you can find other tutorials here...

01:59.001 --> 02:05.000
Have fun working with your group on the TeamBox!
