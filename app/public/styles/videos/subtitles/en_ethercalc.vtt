In this tutorial I'm going to explain how to collaboratively create spreadsheets and calculations on the TeamBox using the app 'Spreadsheet'...

00:10.001 --> 00:13.000
New spreadsheets can be created in this overview.

00:13.001 --> 00:20.000
Here you can also select from a list of already existing spreadsheets and then edit the chosen one.

00:20.001 --> 00:24.000
I have already prepared a spreadsheet for this tutorial.

00:24.001 --> 00:35.000
As you can see, this app's functions are very similar to Microsoft Office Excel. In this tutorial I'm going to explain only the main functions of this app...

00:35.001 --> 00:48.000
You can edit table cells by clicking on them. Then you directly enter text or you can use the text bar on top of the table.

00:48.001 --> 00:57.000
The cell's value can be edited by using the buttons that you can see on top of the table:

00:57.001 --> 01:05.000
You can automatically add all value of numbers in a row by clicking the sum bummon.

01:05.001 --> 01:10.000
The table may also contain links an multi-line text.

01:10.001 --> 01:29.000
In Addition, you can insert more complicated functions: These formulars are sorted by category.

01:29.001 --> 01:29.000
When you can click on a function, is shows a short trext explaining the function and it's formatted contents.

01:29.001 --> 01:35.000
While writing it displays you which parameters are expected.

01:35.001 --> 01:58.000
If you want to declare specific tables cells as the fucntion's parameters, you can mark these cells after indertng the formula. You can also directly give the fild's coords in the function.

01:58.001 --> 01:59.000
Keep in mind to insert the closing bracket to terminate the function's parameter list.

01:59.001 --> 02:08.000
The menubar on top of the page gives you the chance to revert actions, copy and paste text or delete cells.

02:08.001 --> 02:14.000
In addition, you can close cells for further editing.

02:14.001 --> 02:22.000
Lines or rows can be automatically can be filled with the value of a specific cell.

02:22.001 --> 02:27.000
There is the possibility to move the cell's content.

02:27.001 --> 02:39.000
When hovering over the blue dot of a marked cell, you can also fill or move cells that way.

02:39.001 --> 02:47.000
Not alone text can be formatted, tha tables view can be modified, too:

02:47.001 --> 02:56.000
You can add cell borders or you can highlight cells.

02:56.001 --> 03:02.000
In addition you can outline multiple cells

03:02.001 --> 03:12.000
and of course, you can add, delete or hide rows and lines.

03:12.001 --> 03:18.000
If you're searching for a specific value, you can use the search bar which hightlights the search result in the table..

03:18.001 --> 03:24.000
When naviating through the tabs bar, you can edit and format the table

03:24.001 --> 03:28.000
as well as sort rows/its contents.

03:28.001 --> 03:33.000
In addition all steps during work can be displayed.

03:33.001 --> 03:49.000
You can also add a comment or name for a specific cell.

03:49.001 --> 03:56.000
Navigating to the next tab, you can see the last copied text.

03:56.001 --> 04:06.000
Furthermore, you can view the table in a formatted way.

04:06.001 --> 04:17.000
Graphs with values from the table can be generated, too. You have to mark the cells you want to include at first.

04:17.001 --> 04:23.000
Then you can chosse between different graph types.

04:23.001 --> 04:34.001
The graph automatically updates on changes in the table.

04.34.001 --> 04:49.000
Of course, you can download and save your collcaboratively created spradsheets in different file formats.

04:49.001 --> 04:44.000
If you're still looking for help with other apps on the TeamBox you can find other tutorials here...

04:44.001 --> 04:59.000
Have fun working with your group on the TeamBox!
